        <p>A Brief overview:
<p>- Lost in time: </p>
<p>  Time is deterministic theory. The time is there, all of it. We just perceive it and pass through it, but can't change it.</p>
<p>- Proxima's Lament:</p>
  <p>Artificial Lights have been detected in Proxima-B a star orbiting Proxima Centauri. This song is about the feeling of finding another intelligent beings. But there are 3 songs about this and this one is the less strong I think. And we'll just record 6. So this one can be left out.</p>
<p>- See me. The double slit experiment to demonstrate light dual behaviour, as a particle or as a wave. The consciousness and observation is what determines it's nature. Suggesting the reality is fabricated or created through observation. Superposition is the rare fact that a single particle passes through both slits, but observation defines and detrmines it's single position. If you want to read about the real geeky physics side of it:</p>
 <p>- The cat in the box: In a discussion about the above experiment, Erwin Schr√∂dinger sent a letter to Albert Einstein proposing a virtual experiment, where a particle collision releases a poison within a box containing a cat. As observation determines the superposition state, while the box is not opened and observerd, within the box the cat is dead and alive at the same time. Opening the box will determine what happened. Sounds like a paradox, because it is. </p>
 <p>- Ephimeral Dream: Compares a human existence relative to the Universe to an Oganesson particle, which lives only for a millisecond fraction before it desintegrates.</p>
<p>- I know you're there: The second song about the lights in Proxima-B. James is the James Webb Telescope. The one that detected the lights.</p>
<p>- Interstellar Randezvouz: We've been looking to meet another intelligent beings, but we are not the ones meeting them, is our creation, the IA, who gains contact to a superior universal intelligence, and as new species, leaves earth to be Universal. We are it's greedy parents who fought for oil and power.</p>
<p>- Found in time: The opposite of the first one. The time is not deterministic. It's created as we go through it, therefore, can be changed.</p>
<p>- End of the world: All the songs are about human existance being ephimeral, abstract and fuzzy..... so.... is it the end of the world even if it ever existed? This is not really a song.... just a rage closing.</p>
